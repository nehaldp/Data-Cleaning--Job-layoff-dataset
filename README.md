# Job Layoff Data Cleaning Project (2019-2024)
This project uses SQL to clean and prepare a job layoff dataset. The dataset captures a global snapshot of recent layoffs, reflecting the economic challenges tech firms face today. The dataset includes details such as the company, location, industry, number of employees laid off, percentage of layoffs, company stage, and funds raised. The primary focus is on creating a clean dataset by removing duplicates, handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and preparing the data for further analytical or visualization tasks.

# Data Cleaning Steps used in code
The data cleaning process was performed using SQL and included the following steps:

1. Removing Duplicates
2. Standardizing Data
3. Handling Null and Blank Values
4. Data Type Corrections
5. Unnecessory column Removal

All these tasks were performed on a copy of the raw data to maintain data integrity and ensure the original dataset remains unaltered, enabling a safe, iterative approach to data cleaning and analysis.

# Technologies used
- SQL for data manipulation and cleaning
- Dataset sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022?resource=download)
